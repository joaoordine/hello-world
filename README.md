# hello-world
This repository is a test, so that I start learning how to create a new repository
I'm Jo√£o, I'm  a biolofy student at USP and also an undergraduate researcher working with molecular biology and microbiology. I know absolutely nothing about coding and GitHub, that's why I'm doing this, so that I can learn a little bit more.
